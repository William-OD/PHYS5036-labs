Measurements of the energies and lifetimes, or decay rates, of such excited states provide information about the nature of the strong inter-nucleon force responsible for the nucleus as a bound state of neutrons and protons. Excited nuclei can decay, emitting $\\gamma$-rays (energetic photons), $\\alpha$-particles ($^4\\text{He}$ nuclei), $\\beta$-particles (electrons or positrons, together with an unseen neutrino) or, in some cases, by fission into two daughter nuclei of roughly comparable size.\n",

    "### 3.1.2 - WD300/N Multipulser Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Information:\n",
    "- The WD300/N MULTIPULSER MODULE (Figure 1) contains a variable delay unit. \n",
    "- Provides an electronic delay to logic pulses fed into the input. \n",
    "- Has four switchable delay ranges: 50-200 nsec, 0.2-2 msec, 2-20 msec and 20-200 msec. \n",
    "- Each range is variable through a multi-turn potentiometer, but it is necessary to calibrate the setting to obtain the corresponding time delay. \n",
    "- The multipulser has a 'dual' input. \n",
    "- The unused input port must be terminated with a terminator.\n",
    "- Output is via the `DELAY` port. \n",
    "- The two other unused output ports must be terminated with $50\\Omega$ terminators. \n",
    "- The multipulser is capable of providing larger delays than a switched delay box, and also has the advantage that the delayed pulse output by the unit has a standard shape (amplitude -0.8 V, and a fixed pulse width 10 nsec) and is not degraded by attenuation or dispersion in long cables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required equipment is as follows:\n",
    "- Digital oscilloscope \n",
    "- Bipolar pulse generator\n",
    "- Multipulser module located in NIM bin\n",
    "- Standard length (1 metre) coaxial cables with BNC plug connectors\n",
    "- A number of $50\\Omega$ terminators and T-junctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommended Settings:\n",
    "- Pulse generator: \n",
    "    - period: 1 µsec (frequency 1 MHz); \n",
    "    - width: 20 nsec; \n",
    "    - output: negative pulse 0.8 V amplitude.\n",
    "- Digital oscilloscope: \n",
    "    - DC coupled; \n",
    "    - channel 1 vertical scale 500 mV per division; \n",
    "    - channel 2 vertical scale 500 mV per division; \n",
    "    - time sweep 25 nsec per division initially and adjust as required.\n",
    "- Multipulser: range 50 to 200 nsec.\n",

    "- Connect the pulse generator to a discriminator using and set the amplitude and threshold values so that the discriminator produces a train of output logic pulses.\n",
    "- Feed one output logic pulse from a matched pair to channel 1 of the oscilloscope, remembering to use a T-piece and a $50\\Omega$ terminator. \n",
    "- Connect the other matched output to the input of the multipulser unit. Connect the output of the multipulser unit to channel 2 of the oscilloscope, again using a T-piece and a $50\\Omega$ terminator. \n",
    "- All unused input and output ports of the multipulser must be terminated with $50\\Omega$ terminators.\n",
    "- You should now see two pulses on the oscilloscope, with the pulse on channel 2 occuring later than the pulse on channel 1. \n",
    "- The difference in time is due to the difference in cable lengths after the discriminator and the processing time of the multipulser unit. \n",
    "- Determine each of these delays before proceeding.\n",
    "- Switch the multipulser range to 50-200 nsec. \n",
    "- Turn the multi-turn potentiometer to the minimum value 0.0. Note that the form of the output pulse of the multipulser is fixed at about 10 nsec pulse width and -0.8 V amplitude. - Changing the input pulse width or amplitude does not alter the multipulser output pulse form. \n",
    "- Figure 9 shows the form of the scope display; use the horizontal time sweep display to determine the delay between the input and output pulse.Note this delay and the corresponding potentiometer setting.\n",
    "- Increase the potentiometer value by a suitable amount and determine the new delay. \n",
    "- Repeat this process for potentiometer settings across the entire range. \n",
